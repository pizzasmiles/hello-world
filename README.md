GitHub Learning
pizzasmiles here, I know very little about the computer world but I'm here tinkering around in hopes to learn a few things to make daily work a bit easier on myself. Plus I'm hearing things about GitHub so often now, I have the need to explore and see what this place is all about in a lame attemt to stay in the know.
